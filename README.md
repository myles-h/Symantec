# VipAuthTreeNode
A simple authentication node for ForgeRock's Access Manager 6.0 and above.

## Information

VIP Forgerock offers multifactor authentication and mobile application defence capabilities that strengthen the authentication offered natively by OpenAM, and help address key PSD2 requirements around Strong Customer Authentication (SC), and Common and Secure Communication (CSC). 

The following authentication mechanisms are available: 

1) Push to VIP Access Mobile credential (iOS/Android)
2) One Time Password (OTP) using mobile, desktop, hard token
3) Out of band using SMS/Voice
4) Risk Based Authentication for Web authentication
5) Embedded authentication using the VIP Mobile SDK (iOS/Android)
5a) Mobile application defence capabilities (Device Reputation)


## Installation

The VIP OpenAM tree nodes are packaged as a jar file using the maven build tool and are deployed in the ForgeRock Access Management (AM)6 application WEB-INF/lib folder running on tomcat server.

## Steps

1) Configure Maven to be able to access the OpenAM repositories

2) Setup a Maven Project for building the Custom Authentication Node I.e. vip-auth-tree

3) Write the custom logic inside tree nodes to communicate with vip services

4) Change to the root directory of the Maven project of the vip Tree Node Run the mvn package command.

5) The project generates a .jar file containing the VIP custom nodes I.e . VIP OpenAM Tree Nodes, In the form of vip-auth-tree-1.0.jar.

6) Copy the vip-auth-tree-1.0.jar file to the WEB-INF/lib/ folder where AM is deployed

7) Restart AM to load the new plug-in.  The vip tree nodes are now available in the tree designer to use in AM authentication trees

Following are the nodes that are available after deploying the jar file:
